# Project Description

## 1. General

### 1.1. Problem Statement

**The challenges students face:**

Managing lecture slides, notes, and exam preparation often requires juggling multiple tools. This fragmented workflow disrupts focus, wastes time, and complicates learning. Exam prep becomes even more daunting with the manual organization of notes and question generation.
- Too Many Tools: Students constantly switch between slide viewers, note-taking apps, and AI tools. This disrupts their workflow and wastes valuable time.
- Disorganized Conversations with AI: Existing AI tools donâ€™t tie answers to specific lecture slides or notes. Students end up with fragmented conversations and must copy-paste answers back into their notes.
- Tedious Exam Prep: Organizing notes and creating practice questions takes hours. Without automation, itâ€™s hard to focus on understanding concepts deeply.

**How Slide Buddy can help?**

**Slide Buddy** aims to solve this problem by integrating slide viewing, rich-text note-taking, and AI-powered learning tools into a single platform. The solution simplifies study workflows, saves time, and improves comprehension.
- Time Saved: Students can **save up to 3 hours per week** by having all tools in one place. No more switching apps or copy-pasting between tools.
- Efficient Exam Prep: AI-generated summaries and questions **cut revision time by up to 30%**, letting students focus on studying, not organizing.
- Better Retention: Context-aware note-taking and AI-driven explanations help students grasp concepts faster, **improving understanding by up to 40%**.

#### Relevance in the Future:
- Short-Term (2 Years): With increasing reliance on digital tools, Slide Buddy supports both in-person and remote learning environments.

### 1.3. Legal, Open Source Consideration, and Business Model

**Open Source Usage and Licensing**

Slide Buddy is built on open-source technologies like Next.js, Tiptap, Tailwind CSS, and Convex. These tools make development faster and more reliable while ensuring compliance with established open-source licenses. While open-sourcing the project under an MIT license could support collaboration and community-driven improvements, unique featuresâ€”like contextual AI workflows and modular architectureâ€”can be considered to remain proprietary to protect the platformâ€™s competitive edge.

**Business Model**

At this stage, Slide Buddy focuses on user acquisition and feedback through a **freemium model**. Core features, such as slide viewing, note-taking, and basic AI functionalities, are available for free, ensuring accessibility and encouraging adoption among students and educators. Premium features, like unlimited slide uploads, personalized flashcards, and advanced analytics, provide an opportunity for monetization. As the platform grows, subscription plans for individuals and institutions or enterprise licensing partnerships with schools and universities could open potential long-term revenue streams.

### 1.4. Competition Analysis

Slide Buddy integrates features that address gaps in the tools students commonly use:

#### Competitor Comparison Table

| **Tool** | **Strengths** | **Gaps** |
|-|-|-|
| **Notion** | Flexible workspace for note-taking, project management, and databases | No real-time annotation or lecture-specific workflows |
| **Mem.ai** | AI-driven organization for personal notes, focuses on workflow recall | Lacks integration with slides or tools for exam preparation |
| **StudyPotion** | Converts lecture materials into flashcards and interactive study aids | Limited note-taking capabilities and no contextual AI assistance |
| **NotebookLM** | Summarizes and interacts with uploaded documents using AI | Not optimized for live lectures or slide-based workflows |
| **OneNote** | Allows slide-linked notes and flexible formatting for various workflows | No built-in AI features for clarifications or automated exam prep tools |

**Why Slide Buddy stands out?**

Slide Buddy combines the best of these tools into one platform. Students can take notes along with slides in real-time, ask contextual questions, and generate exam materialsâ€”all without leaving the app. Itâ€™s designed for the modern student who needs everything at their fingertips.

#### SWOT Analysis for Slide Buddy

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|-|-|

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1. UI Implementation

#### a. Design

**Evaluation:**

- **Layout and Structure**: The main components such as the header, sidebar, and main content area are separated.
- **Color Scheme**: We use a consistent color scheme with gradients and background colors that enhance the visual appeal. Mostly minimal but with the gradient-styled buttons as visual cue.
- **Fonts**: We use the Geologica font from Google Fonts (to enhance displaying of Vietnamese, main language of one team member :D)
- **Buttons and Icons**: Buttons are styled uniformly with gradient backgrounds and hover effects. Icons are used appropriately to enhance the user experience.
- **Navigation**: The navigation is simple and clear. The use of Clerk for authentication ensures that the user experience is smooth. Routes like /learning-hub/[slideId] make context-specific navigation easy for users (breadcrumbs).

**UI Kit:**

- **Colors**: The project uses a combination of blue, purple, and cyan gradients for buttons and backgrounds as a signature.
- **Fonts**: Geologica font from Google Fonts.
- **Buttons**: Customized the shadcn/ui button using Tailwind CSS with gradient backgrounds and hover effects.
- **Icons**: Used icons from shadcn/ui in the sidebar and other components to enhance the user experience.

#### b. Novel Features

Some of our features that could be considered:
- **React Routing**: Next.js App Router for routing, which enables dynamic, modular routing (e.g., /learning-hub/[slideId]) for slide-specific interactions.
- **Real-time Updates**: We use Convex for real-time updates, ensuring that the user sees the latest data without needing to refresh the page.
- **AI Integration**: We integrate Langchain for text embedding and Google Generative AI for text generation, providing advanced features for note-taking and slide analysis. Users can ask questions or request clarifications directly tied to the context of specific slides.
- **Responsive Design and Advanced Animations**: We use Tailwind CSS to make sure the app adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, with animations, such as hover scaling effects on buttons and cards.
